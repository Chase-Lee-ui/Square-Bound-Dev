# Square-Bound-Dev
 
This is the finalized release of the Beginner Circle Game Jam #3 of 2020. We had two weeks to create this entire project from scratch. This was each collaborators first-ever experience in the world of Unity aside from some tutorials, so there was definitely a lot to learn. The main takeaway from this project would definitely be time management. We had bi-daily meetings to see the progress we were making, but the goals we set put us behind in the latter half of the time allotted. We followed the Software Development Life Cycle and took in criticism and actively changed the game to those criticisms.
